                    <h3>Features & Usage</h3>

                    <p><strong>Q: Can I pause the breathing exercise mid-way?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Currently, you can exit at any time, but the exercise restarts from the beginning if you
                        return.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: How does the streak work?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Complete at least 1 timer per day to maintain your streak. You have a 48-hour grace period if
                        you miss a day.</p>

                    <p><strong>Q: Can I edit or delete a completed timer?</strong></p>
                    <p>A: Not currently. This ensures data integrity for your stats. If you marked a timer incorrectly,
                        the impact on overall stats is minimal.</p>
