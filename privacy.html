                    <p>Welcome to HelpStash. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our iOS application ("App").</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> HelpStash is designed with privacy as a core principle. We collect minimal data, and everything is stored locally on your device.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Apple processes your payment information (we never see your credit card)</li>
                        <li>Apple provides us with a <strong>receipt</strong> to verify your subscription status</li>
                        <li>We do not store or have access to your payment details</li>
                    </ul>

                <section id="analytics">
                    <h2>5. Analytics & Usage Data</h2>

                    <p><strong>We do NOT collect any analytics or usage data.</strong> HelpStash is a local-only app - all your data stays on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or third parties.</p>

                    <p>This means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>❌ No tracking of feature usage</li>
                        <li>❌ No crash reports sent to us</li>
                        <li>❌ No behavioral analytics</li>
                        <li>❌ No third-party analytics services (no Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why?</strong> Your financial behavior is private. We designed HelpStash to never require an internet connection or server infrastructure.</p>
                </section>

                <section id="data-sharing">
                    <h2>6. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>

                    <p><strong>We cannot share your data because we do not collect it.</strong> Since HelpStash stores all data locally on your device (not on our servers), we have no data to sell, rent, share, or disclose.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legal Requests:</strong> If law enforcement requests user data, we cannot provide it because we don't have it. Any legal process would need to be directed at you and your device, not us.</p>

                    <p><strong>Apple Subscription Data:</strong> The only information we have access to is your subscription status (via Apple's receipt verification). This is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>, not ours.</p>

                    <h2>7. Your Rights & Data Control</h2>

                    <h3>7.1 Access Your Data</h3>
                    <p>All your data is visible within the app's Stats and Settings screens. You have complete control over your information.</p>

                    <h3>7.2 Delete Your Data</h3>
                    <p>To delete all your data:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the app → Settings</li>
                        <li>Scroll to "Delete All Data"</li>
                        <li>Confirm deletion</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Alternatively, uninstalling the app permanently deletes all local data.</p>

                    <h3>7.3 Export Data</h3>
                    <p>Currently, data export is not available. You can manually review all your data within the Stats screen.</p>

                    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data stored locally on your device (protected by iOS security)</li>
                        <li>Encrypted communication with Apple services (StoreKit)</li>
                        <li>No transmission of personal data to external servers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> No method of storage is 100% secure. Protect your device with a passcode or biometric authentication.</p>

                    <p>If you are located in the European Union, you have rights under GDPR. However, because HelpStash stores all data locally on your device (not on our servers), most GDPR data requests do not apply to us:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> We have no data about you to provide. All your data (purchase history, stats, streaks) is stored locally on your device. You can view it anytime in the app's Stats screen.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can edit your data directly in the app (e.g., edit purchase amounts, delete individual entries). We do not store your data, so there is nothing for us to correct.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> We have no data to delete. To delete your local data, see Section 7.2 (delete from app Settings → Data & Privacy, or uninstall the app).</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> We cannot export your data because we do not collect or store it. Your data never leaves your device.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Apple Subscription Data:</strong> The only information related to you that we can access is your subscription status (via Apple's receipt verification). This is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. To exercise GDPR rights regarding your Apple ID or subscription data, contact <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/contact/" target="_blank">Apple directly</a>.</p>

                        <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> We do not sell your personal information. We never have, and never will.</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> We do not discriminate based on exercise of CCPA rights.</li>
                    </ul>
